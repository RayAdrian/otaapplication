What was the last piece of software you worked on? What did you specifically build? What challenges did you encounter and how did you overcome them?

The last piece of software I worked on was for Contact Creatives Limited, a platform that connects creative talent with brands for their creative projects. My focus was on enhancing user interaction by building the messaging feature.

I developed the real-time messaging functionality to facilitate seamless communication between talents and clients. The implementation involved:
	•	GraphQL for efficient querying and updating of messaging data.
	•	WebSockets to enable real-time updates.

The most significant challenge was establishing a stable WebSocket connection. Initially, connections were not being established reliably, which impacted real-time updates. This required:
	•	Close collaboration with the backend lead to debug the issue. We worked together to ensure compatibility between the WebSocket server and the client.
	•	Implementing proper connection retries and error handling on the frontend.

Another challenge was ensuring the data structure exchanged between the frontend and backend was consistent. This involved:
	•	Multiple back-and-forth discussions with the backend team to align on the GraphQL schema and payload format.
	•	Writing unit tests and simulating different scenarios to validate data consistency and performance.

Through this collaborative and iterative approach, we were able to deliver a feature that enhanced the platform’s usability.

The messaging feature was successfully deployed, improving user engagement by enabling real-time communication. It became a key component of the platform and received positive feedback from users.
